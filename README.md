# XPayBack Assignment

## Introduction
This is a multi module Android app made for XPayBack Interview screening, It consists of two screens - a User listing screen and an user details screen. The app allows users to view a list of users, search for users, and view user details. It follows the MVVM architecture, utilizes Retrofit for REST API calls, KOIN for Dependency Injection, and Lifecycle for Kotlin coroutines. Additionally, the app implements Navigation Component from Jetpack to navigate between fragments, and has also been segregated into two modules:
- core: for all its core functionalities such as network service etc.
- app: for UI and app layer tasks.

It improves the code readability as well as increases the hot build time significantly.
