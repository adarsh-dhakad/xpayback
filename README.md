# XPayBack Assignment

## Introduction
This is a multi module Android app made for XPayBack Interview screening, It consists of two screens - a User listing screen and an user details screen. The app allows users to view a list of users, search for users, and view user details. It follows the MVVM architecture, utilizes Retrofit for REST API calls, KOIN for Dependency Injection, and Lifecycle for Kotlin coroutines. Additionally, the app implements Navigation Component from Jetpack to navigate between fragments, and has also been segregated into two modules:
- core: for all its core functionalities such as network service etc.
- app: for UI and app layer tasks.

It improves the code readability as well as increases the hot build time significantly.

## Technologies Used

The app leverages modern technologies and follows best practices to ensure efficiency and maintainability. The major tech used in this project are:

- MVVM Architecture: Separating the app into layers of Model, View, and ViewModel to promote a clean and maintainable codebase.
- Retrofit: Handling REST API calls to retrieve and send data to the server.
- KOIN: Managing dependency injection to decouple classes and improve testability.
- Kotlin Coroutines with Lifecycle: Managing background tasks and asynchronous operations efficiently while respecting Android lifecycle.
- Navigation Component: Navigating between fragments in the app seamlessly.
- Sealed Classes: Handling generic responses and providing clear and consistent feedback to users.

## Testing

The app has been thoroughly tested to ensure its functionality and stability in various scenarios and conditions.
